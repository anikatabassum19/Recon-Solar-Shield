# Recon Solar Shield Initiative

The **Recon Solar Shield Initiative** is a cutting-edge space-weather monitoring and protection system. It predicts magnetic reconnection events an hour in advance and uses IoT technology to safeguard power grids by automatically disconnecting power lines during these events. This system also features a web interface for real-time space weather observation.

## Features

- **Magnetic Reconnection Prediction**: Predicts events an hour ahead using data from NASA's ACE and Discover satellites.
- **Automated Power Grid Protection**: Automatically disconnects power lines via IoT to prevent grid damage.
- **Real-Time Space Weather Monitoring**: Provides live updates and insights through a web-based interface.

## Technologies Used

- **NASA Open APIs**: Fetches real-time data from the ACE and Discover satellites.
- **IoT Integration**: Enables automatic power line disconnection during high-risk events.
- **Web Development**: Interactive website for space weather visualization and monitoring.
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript (or your chosen stack).
- **Frameworks**: Flask/Django for backend, React/Svelte for frontend (replace with your specific choices).

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system fetches space weather data from NASA's ACE and Discover satellites using open APIs.
2. **Event Prediction**: Algorithms analyze the data to detect magnetic reconnection events an hour in advance.
3. **IoT Integration**: When an event is predicted, the system sends a signal to IoT-enabled devices to disconnect power lines.
4. **User Interface**: A web-based platform allows users to monitor space weather and view prediction results in real time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anikatabassum19/recon-solar-shield.git
   cd recon-solar-shield
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Frontend (if using a separate frontend)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## Usage

- **Monitor Space Weather**: Use the web interface to observe real-time data from NASA's satellites.
- **Grid Protection**: The system automatically protects power grids during high-risk magnetic reconnection events.
